# blender-2.8-script
blender 2.8 script moving object along curves.
need to have addon LoopTools installed because i used it to make points equidistants on the curves.
i created it to make a character walk randomly alongs curves.
As example download the .py and the the blender file.open blender file and in the Scripting tab open the .py and run it.
for the curves use bezier or nurbs and not poly
here a test but i have to check some problems:https://youtu.be/wIDnOaysS40
