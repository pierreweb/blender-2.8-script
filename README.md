# blender-2.8-script
blender 2.8 script moving object along curves.
need to have addon LoopTools installed because i used it to make points equidistants on the curves.
i created it to make a character walk randomly alongs curves.

for the curves use bezier or nurbs and not poly

I have made another version(moveonpathmethode2) which use followpath constraint:https://ahp.li/64773a203defe72c4557.mp4
how to use it:
download the blend(1 or 2),open it  and run the script(Scripting tab) and play animation
